# Bravo's UI Improvements

![release](https://github.com/JonasKnarbakk/BravosUIImprovements/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

User interface improvements to the default UI in World of Warcraft. The goal is not to deviate from the default UI and replace existing frames with something more fancy,
but rather enhance what's already there with features most users might wish was there by default.

All features are optional and if they're not enabled no code related to that feature should be running.

## features

- Class color on Unit Frame healthbars
- Timers on all castbars and Icon on player castbar
- Move castbar on top for Target and Focus
- Change sorting direction for bags
- Hide Stance Bar
- Add Quick Keybind Mode button to ESC menu
- Expansion in tooltip
- Improved Edit Mode:
    - Added On Hover visibility to action bars, bags and micro menu
    - Hide macro text on action bars
    - Abbreviated keybinding text (like ElvUI)
    - Move LFG eye independent of micro menu
