## Changed in v2025.1

* Siren Isle: quest updates, add the Proper Parrot to pirate rares
* Don't get the wrong coordinates for mobs when the vignette is in the parent zone and doesn't have location data in the child zone (see: the Forbidden Vault)
* General better display of unknown coordinates
* Make macro updates less spammy (only edit the macro if it has actually changed)
