## Changed in v2024.33

* More Siren Isle data
* Fixed the locations for a few enemies in Dun Morogh
* Port the right-click menus on map icons to the new menu system
* Sneakily disable the AddOnSkins integration with SilverDragon if it's installed, since it's been completely broken and my single biggest source of bug reports for several years now
